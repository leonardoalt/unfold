# Puzzle

I want to make a puzzle game that runs on the browser, so js (or ts).

The game starts as a normal puzzle, showing you the image, breaking it down into pieces, and you have to put them together.
When the pieces are in the right order, you win.

Then, the image zooms out, and another image that contains it appears.
The game goes on infinitely like this.

1. Initialize this directory as that code base.
2. Add the necessary code.
3. Tell me how to launch the game and play it.
